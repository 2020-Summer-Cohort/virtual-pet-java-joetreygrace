# Virtual Pet

See the HELP.md for assignment directions and guide.

VirtualPetApplication class runs the game. In there I call gameLoop method from VirtualPet class which runs the game dialogue. I also whyYouLost method from VirtualPet class which runs to tell the user why the game has ended.

I created VirtualPet class to hold all my game code.
